Replication Package for the paper entitled"-------"

Dataset: To answer the research questions, we considered two different datasets. The first is the same one used in: "S. Cresci, R. Di Pietro, M. Petrocchi, A. Spognardi, and M. Tesconi, “The paradigm-shift of social spambots: Evidence, theories, and tools for the arms race,” in Proceedings of the 26th international conference on World wide web companion, 2017, pp. 963–972", which comprises actual human authors with numerous tweets. 

Detection Models: To address RQ3, to detect the LLMs and human authors, we chose five supervised machine learning (ML) models, namely Linear Support Vector Machine, Support Vector Machines with RBF kernel, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest, organized all in .ipynb files:

DecisionTree.ipynb;
LogisticRegression.ipynb;
RandomForest.ipynb;
SVMLinear.ipynb;
SVM_RBF.ipynb
